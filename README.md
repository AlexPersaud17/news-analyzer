# Smart News Analyzer & Classifier

## Overview

The **Smart News Analyzer & Classifier** is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project designed to analyze and classify news articles. This application leverages various NLP techniques, including sentiment analysis, text classification, named entity recognition (NER), and similarity analysis. The project aims to provide a powerful tool for automating the analysis and categorization of news content.

The project is built using Python, with dependencies on libraries such as **scikit-learn**, **spaCy**, **Streamlit**, and **Chromadb**. The system utilizes models like **TfidfVectorizer**, **Logistic Regression**, and pre-trained embeddings for tasks like sentiment analysis and text similarity.

## Key Features

- **Text Classification**: Classifies news articles into predefined categories (e.g., technology, politics, sports).
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the sentiment of articles (positive, neutral, or negative).
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifies and classifies entities like people, organizations, and locations within the text.
- **Similarity Search**: Uses vector-based search to find articles similar to a given query.
